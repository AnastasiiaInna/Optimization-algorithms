 Metaheuristic algorithms for the Set Partitioninig Problem

There is presented a genetic, tabu serach and scatter search algorithms for solving the set partitioning problem (SPP). 
The set partitioning problem is a combinatorial problem used by airlines as a mathematical model for flight crew scheduling.
The attached .pdf file contains the detailed information about the SPP and implemented genetic algorithm.
